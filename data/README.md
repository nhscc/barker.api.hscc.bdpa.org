# Precomputed Barker Conversations

The complete corpus of conversations that (generated) users have with one

a large metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw
movie scripts.

If for some reason you want to regenerate the corpus, run
[`node ./generate-corpus.js`](./generate-corpus.js).
